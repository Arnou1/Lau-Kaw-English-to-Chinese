# 项目旨意
刘寇英译汉 (LK2C) 取名于最初两位创作者的姓氏，旨在系统地将诘屈聱牙的英文词汇译为朗朗上口的中文术语，免去拼写英文之烦恼。

目前 LK2C 仅限于部分游戏相关词汇，期望未来能扩大语料库。


# What is the purpose of this project?
Lau-Kaw-English-to-Chinese (LK2C) is named after surnames of its creators, it is a systamtic approach to translate hard-to-pronounce
English words into easy-to-pronouce Chinese parlance in hope of alleviating the pain of typing these English words.

Currently only a selected few of gaming parlance has been translated using LK2C, 
we definitely wish to expand the corpus in the future.
