# What is the purpose of this project?
Lau-Kaw-English-to-Chinese (LK2C) is named after the surname of its creators, it is a systamtic approach to translate hard-to-pronounce
English words into more fluent Chinese coinages. Currently only a selected few of gaming console parlance has been translated using LK2C, 
we definitely wish to expand the corpus in the future.
